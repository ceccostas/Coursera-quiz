##Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
#First make numeric vectors with the function c(,,) to do after my matrix 
x1<- c(2,1,4) #x1 is the name for the first vector
x1 #return the numeric vector

x2<- c(1,2,6) #x2 is the name for the second vector
x2 #return the numeric vector

x3<-c(4,6,8) # x3 is the name for the third vector
x3 # return the numeric vector

#Make the matrix with the funtion rbind(), with 3 cols and 2 rows. 
#Each vector are the row in my matrix
makeCacheMatrix<- rbind(x1,x2,x3) # I named my matrix, makeCacheMatrix 
makeCacheMatrix # return the matrix with my three vectors (x1,x2,x3)

#To do the inverse the matrix, I use the function solve()
cacheSolve<- solve(makeCacheMatrix) # I named cacheSolve to my inverse matrix 
cacheSolve # return the inverse matrix
