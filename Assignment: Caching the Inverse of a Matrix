####Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
##For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible
#The first function called makeCacheMatrix ,creates an special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
#This first function makeCacheMatrix, is really a list containing a function to:
#1. set the value of the matrix
#2. get the value of the matrix
#3. set the value of the inverse
#4. get the value of the inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() i
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}
#The function cacheSolve gets the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}
### Testing those functions 
#Example below

a<- matrix(c(1,2,3,4),2,2) # I did a matrix that I called a 
a # return a matrix with 2 cols and 2 rows 
a1<- makeCacheMatrix(a)
cacheSolve(a1) # Inverse returned from cache
